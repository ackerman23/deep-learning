üê∂ Comprehensive Multiclass Dog Breed Classification
This notebook constructs an end-to-end multiclass image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

1. Problem
The task involves identifying the breed of a dog based on an input image.

Imagine sitting at a cafe, taking a photo of a dog, and wanting to determine its breed.

2. Data
The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from Kaggle's dog breed data:

[Dog Breed Identification Data on Kaggle
](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data)

3. Evaluation
The evaluation involves a file containing prediction probabilities for each dog in each test image.

4. Features
Key information about the data:

Involves images (unstructured data), making deep learning/transfer learning the preferred approach.
Encompasses 120 dog breeds (equivalent to 120 different classes).
Consists of over 10,000 images in the training set, each labeled.
Contains over 10,000 images in the test set without labels, necessitating predictions.
